## Summary 

In this project, I used HTML and CSS to develop a  sign-up form for <em> desktop </em> browsers to demonstrate the intermediate HTML and CSS skills I learned in the previous lessons. The project information can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

The following are essential factors to consider in order to accomplish the project: 

#### Basic Requirements 
1. Develop a form layout inspired by the provided design example. 
2. Choose a suitable image for the form's background.
3. Use a font from a third party for the wordmark of the logo. 
4. Incorporate a logo image.
5. Using a semi-transparent banner, overlay the logo image and wordmark on the background image.
6. Match the color tone of the Sign Up button with the background image. 
7. Use at least two color variations for :focus and :invalid pseudo classes. 
8. Ensure the form is optimally displayed on most desktop browsers, while mobile compatibility is not a primary concern at this stage.
9. Optionally, use JavaScript for password confirmation if confidence allows; otherwise, validate each entry separately.
